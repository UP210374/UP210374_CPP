#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main (){
        //Declaration of variables
    int income;
    float income1, totalAmountdue,tax, tax1;
        //Ask the user your income
    cout << "Enter your annual income: $"; 
    cin >> income;
        //Assess the user's income to obtain the percentage to be paid
    if (income>0 && income<10000){
        tax=0.05;
    }
        else if (income >= 10000 && income<20000){
            tax=0.15;
    }
    else if (income >=20000 && income<35000){
            tax= 0.20;
    }
    else if (income>=35000 && income<=60000){
            tax=0.30;
    }
    else if (income>60000){
            tax=0.45;
    }
        //Calculate total amount due the user with your tax
    tax1= tax*100;
    cout << "Your tax is: " << tax1 << "%" << endl;
    income1=(income*tax);
    totalAmountdue=(income-income1);
        //Show the user your total amount due
    cout << "Your total amount due is: " << "$" << totalAmountdue << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Exercise 2. Benefits

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In a given company, its employees are evaluated at the end of each year.

The table below shows the levels corresponding to each score. The

score of the level.  </div>
			
			| Level | Score |
			--- | --- 
			Unacceptable |  0.0
			Acceptable |  0.4
			Meritorious |  0.6 or higher

Write a program that reads the user's score and indicates his performance level,
as well as the amount of money the user will receive.

##### Code

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main (){
    double bonus, score;
    int percentage;

    cout << "Enter your score: ";
    cin >> score;
    //evaluation of the user's score so that you know what your bonus is
    if (score==0.0 && score==0.4 && score>=0.6){
        percentage=score*100;
        cout << "Your percentage obtain in evaluetion is: " << percentage << "%" << endl;
        cout << "Your bonus is: " <<"$"<< bonus << endl;
